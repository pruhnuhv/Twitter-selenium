This is a Twitter bot where you can enter your username and password in the #MAIN BODY of the code and then whenever you run it, it will Tweet out a greeting with the current date and then Tweet out the number of unread notifications that you have. The purpose of this bot is more or less to provide a basic template towards working with Twitter And Selenium. Since the bot uses selenium, A Twitter dev account and API keys aren't necessary.
